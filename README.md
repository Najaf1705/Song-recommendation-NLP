# NLP-Based Song Recommendation Using TF-IDF and NLTK

> **Abstract** : The increasing demand for personalized music has driven the creation of recommendation systems tailored to individual preferences. This project introduces an NLP-based song recommendation system using NLTK and TF-IDF to recommend songs based on lyrics or user input. The system preprocesses song lyrics with tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming, then applies TF-IDF to transform the text into numerical vectors that quantify the significance of each term.

Using cosine similarity, the system compares the user's input with existing song data to identify the most relevant songs. By analyzing lyrical themes and content, the system offers personalized recommendations that match user preferences. This model can be enhanced by incorporating additional factors like user listening history or genre preferences to improve the accuracy and depth of song suggestions, showcasing the potential of text-based data in music recommendation systems.
